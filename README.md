# Caffeine Visualization
I submitted this to the July Dataviz Battle on r/dataisbeautiful.

To create this visualization, I began with a boxplot with caffeine plotted on a log scale.
Next, I utilized Procreate for iPad and an Apple Pencil to draw the overlayed images. 
Finally, I recreated the orginal boxplot with no color or grid to overlay the outline of the boxplots and the outliers on my sketches.
